The Roblox model is here:
https://www.roblox.com/library/6146503994<br>
And a test place:
https://www.roblox.com/games/6146796086

<b>Folder structure</b>
The main script can go in ServerScriptService or wherever, as can the Config script.<br>
Assets can go anywhere, and must have their sub-folders parented to them.<br>
The RendererHealthDebug ScreenGui should be parented to the client renderer script.<br>

Proper documentation in the source of Config (for users) and the main script (for contributors) - PRs greatly appreciated<br>
Large parts of this are inefficient and smelly - apologies<br>
If you have any issues, feel free to contact me on Roblox (regibus361)
